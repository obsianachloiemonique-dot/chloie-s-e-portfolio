<p>In lesson 2, I learned about the structure of CSS and the three kinds of stylesheets; The external stylesheet is the most global one and it can affect all the pages, the embedded stylesheet is document-wide and can affect one page, while internal stylesheet override external and embedded, it is used for isolated changes to headers, paragraphs and other elements.</p>

<p>In lesson 3, I learned about display properties; the block-level displays text vertically, while the inline-level displays text horizontally. I also learned about div and span tag and its attribute 'class'; the div tag is used for adding styles for block-level elements like paragraphs, while the span tag is used for adding styles to inline-level elements. The class attribute indicates the style to be applied.</p>

<p>In lesson 4, I learned about classes; classes are used for formatting texts and it allows you to apply the same style to many html elements. Classes can be used for different elements and you can use more than one class to an element. I also learned that you can have classes for a specific element like p.classname, it can only be used for paragraphs.</p>

<p>In lesson 5, I learned about css selectors; selectors are used in external stylesheets, they have an external file. Selectors have 6 types; Class selectors, Element selector or Tag selector, ID selector, Universal selector, Group selector and Attribute selector. CSS selectors are used to “find” or “select” the HTML elements that you want to style.</p>

<p>In lesson 6, I learned about dimensions; dimension are used to manage visibility, height and width of different HTML elements. There are also Pseudo-classes arent user-defined and are used for specific HTML elements only. Example is the anchor element which has four pseudo-classes; the Link, Hover, Visited and Active which have a specific order which is LVHA.</p>

<h2>Second quarter events</h2>
<p><span class="ind">Buwan ng wika:</span></p>
<p>The most important thing I learned during the Buwan ng wika is to appreciate your language and culture, and how important it is to share your culture with others.

I think I participated actively because I wore Filipiniana every week to school. I would explain this event as something very empowering because as a Filipino, it sparks nationality inside me, especially with the political problems we are currently experiencing. Its important to have this event because by doing this, we can teach the youth to love their country and origin. </p>
